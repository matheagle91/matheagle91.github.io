# About

Hello. I am Eric Ostrom. I am currently working on my masters degree in applied mathematics. My masters project is called the traveling salesman problem. When someone needs to travel to several locations, what is the best route. The problem is that there are too many possible solutions to find the best, so we need a method to find it faster.

In my free time, I like to play video games. I mostly play action/adventure games, but I do play some first person shooters. I also like to watch TV and movies. I mostly like crime dramas and sci-fi/fantasy TV shows. I mostly watch action and sci-fi/fantasy movies.
